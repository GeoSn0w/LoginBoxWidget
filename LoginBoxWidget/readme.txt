A simple conditional login box widget for the sidebar.

== Description ==

The idea is simple, the plugin adds a widget to the sidebar that can work in two modes. If the user is authenticated it shows "Hello <username>" and a button that goes to the user profile settings page,
and if the user is not authenticated it will show a button called "Authenticate" that will show the login form if pressed.
